# Specifications #

### Overview ###

Included in this section are samples of different technical specifications, largely focused on functional requirements and API technical details.  These are intended to be mostly formal, following a rigid format and covering the full scope of the target material to allowing a team to either implement the features detailed or integrate with the API described.  Each document is intended to be self-contained and stand-alone.  In the event that documents are loosely related, the summary text for the document will make note of it.

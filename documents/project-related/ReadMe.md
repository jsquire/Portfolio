* **source-control-candidate-evaluation.docx**
  <br />_This document summarizes an investigation into a final set of candidates, Team Foundation Server and Subversion, for adoption as the source control provider for a development team.  Key to the comparison was the overall cost of the solution, both in terms of initial purchase and support as well as the total cost of ownership.  Of equal concern is that the development team was relatively inexperienced and used to working with Visual Source Safe._<br />
  <br />_The result of this evaluation was the adoption of Subversion.  The team guidance for the standards and process around it can be found in the [Subversion Source Control Practices](../development-team-guidance/subversion-source-control-practices.docx "Subversion Source Control Practices") document._

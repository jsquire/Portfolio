### Items ###

* **e-commerce-site-service-level-agreement.docx**
  <br />_This document outlines a service level agreement between the owner of an e-commerce website and the external development team.  Intended to ensure that both parties understand support and remediation responsibilities in the case of performance issues, the SLA outlines an approach to performance monitoring to ensure usability for target audiences as well as defining the key metrics by which performance is measured._
  
* **google-checkout-integration.docx**
  <br />_This document describes an integration strategy and high level architecture for offering Google Checkout as an option for customers in an existing e-commerce site.  As an enhancement to an existing site with an established checkout flow and order processing pipeline, the Google Commerce integration approach was expected to plug into the existing process and technology as much as possible, with a goal of reusing infrastructure from a similar Amazon Payments enhancement.  A key constraint was the mandate that no customization or enhancement could be performed on the SAP ERP system that controlled the order processing in order to avoid third-party consultants as a cost-savings measure._
  

* **content-management-workflow.docx**<br />
  **content-management-workflow-diagrams.xlsx**
  <br />_These documents describe the workflows for creation and promotion of content in a custom CMS system.  The design utilizes a sandbox-style approach in which there is a single instance of the CMS that provides content for all environments, rather than attempting to push content through independent CMS systems for each environment.  The workflow addresses the standard content states in a typical lifecycle, from development through QA and into production._

* **somo-swipe-technology-details.docx**<br />
  **somo-swipe-patent-diagrams.vsd**
  <br />_These documents serve as part of the set of materials submitted for a patent on the use of gestures to control advertisement behaviors on mobile devices filed by [SoMo Audience](http://somoaudience.com/ "SoMo Audience") for its [Swipe Advertising](http://www.swipeadvertising.com/ "Swipe Advertising") products.  The patent, on which I am listed as an inventor, is still in government review._

* **source-control-candidate-evaluation.docx**
  <br />_This document summarizes an investigation into a final set of candidates, Team Foundation Server and Subversion, for adoption as the source control provider for a development team.  Key to the comparison was the overall cost of the solution, both in terms of initial purchase and support as well as the total cost of ownership.  Of equal concern is that the development team was relatively inexperienced and used to working with Visual Source Safe._<br />
  <br />_The result of this evaluation was the adoption of Subversion.  The team guidance for the standards and process around it can be found in the [Subversion Source Control Practices](../development-team-guidance/subversion-source-control-practices.docx "Subversion Source Control Practices") document._
  
* **solr-installation-configuration.docx**
  <br />_Written in early 2012, this document details the instructions necessary for the installation and configuration of a virtual machine-based local development environment for the Solr search engine.  The versions of products mentioned, screenshots used, and the source urls that appear in the document reflect the versions of products that were current at that point in time._

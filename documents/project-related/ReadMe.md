### Items ###

* **e-commerce-site-service-level-agreement.docx**
  <br />_This document outlines a service level agreement between the owner of an e-commerce website and the external development team.  Intended to ensure that both parties understand support and remediation responsibilities in the case of performance issues, the SLA outlines an approach to performance monitoring to ensure usability for target audiences as well as defining the key metrics by which performance is measured._
  
* **source-control-candidate-evaluation.docx**
  <br />_This document summarizes an investigation into a final set of candidates, Team Foundation Server and Subversion, for adoption as the source control provider for a development team.  Key to the comparison was the overall cost of the solution, both in terms of initial purchase and support as well as the total cost of ownership.  Of equal concern is that the development team was relatively inexperienced and used to working with Visual Source Safe._<br />
  <br />_The result of this evaluation was the adoption of Subversion.  The team guidance for the standards and process around it can be found in the [Subversion Source Control Practices](../development-team-guidance/subversion-source-control-practices.docx "Subversion Source Control Practices") document._

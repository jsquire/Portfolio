### Items ###

* **complex-ecommerce-and-marketing-site.mpp**
  _This document is a formal granular estimate intended to form the basis for a project plan.  This estimate is for a large and complex e-commerce and marketing website, to be integrated with the client's existing order management system and database infrastructure.  The new site is being designed by a third party firm and the client development team is responsible for the IT infrastructure.  The development is being performed using the client's source control and environment._
  
* **solr-ecommerce-search-provider.mpp**
  _This document is a formal granular estimate intended to form the basis for a project plan.  This estimate is for integrating the Solr search engine into an existing e-commerce platform that currently runs multiple site.  The browse-and-search functionality was written in a manner specific to the Endeca search engine, and has recently undergone refactoring to allow other search engines based on a set of well-known interfaces and other abstractions.  The extension points and abstractions are still in the rough; this implementation will continue to refine them as time allows._
  
* **ecommece-mobile-ad-samples.xlsx**
  _This document is a semi-formal high level estimate, intended for discussion with stakeholders.  This estimate is for creation of sample ad placements within an existing e-commerce site structure which would replace the current desktop ad implementation when the site is rendered for mobile devices.  As part of the implementation, rough prototyping would be done to allow mobile-targeted ads to be administered through an existing management portal._
  
* **golf-course-data-entry-site.docx**
  _This document is a semi-formal high level estimate in more of a long-form presentation, intended for submission to stakeholders for approval.  This estimate is for conversion of an existing set of InfoPath forms used by the members and staff of a golf course on tablet devices.  Some minor informational areas are also included to guide members through some of the forms necessary to serve their requests._

# Toolbox

### Overview

This section is intended to collect an eclectic mix of utility-type implementations across a variety of languages which often come in handy for use elsewhere.  These toolbox items are small and sometimes simple constructs but ones that I find myself returning to frequently as helpful.  Though organized into rough project collections by language, the assets herein are mostly each self-contained and not logically a part of a larger overall project or ecosystem. 

I consider these artifacts to be an active work-in-progress.  They've been created and refined over an extended period of time and will continue to evolve going forward as my needs and preferences change, and I learn and grow.  

### Structure

* **csharp**  
  _The container for the set of tools written in C#.  These have been organized into a single set of projects for easier reference and mintenance, though the do not form a cohesive application._

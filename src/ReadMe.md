### Overview ###

Included in this section are code samples, organized by project/problem.  Each project or problem is intended to be self-contained and stand-alone.  Some are focused on a single language, while others include implementations in multiple languages.  For the latter, these will be organized with each implementation language in a dedicated sub-folder.  Each will contain a ReadMe to provide an overview and context.   

In some cases, the samples may be a subset of functionality, where in others they may be a full and functional application.  Please remember that each project is intended to be a representation of my coding approach, style, habits, and thought process, not to illustrate large, complex, and complete systems.

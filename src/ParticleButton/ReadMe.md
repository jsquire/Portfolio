# Particle Internet Button

### Summary

The [Particle Internet button](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/button/core/) is a cloud-enabled IOT device based on the [Particle Photon][1] chip set.  It comes fully assembled, which avoids the needs to build out a breadboard or perform any soldering.  

With built-in WiFi and the ability to interact with the outside world using web hooks for both incoming and outgoing requests, it makes for a simple, approachable device with which to explore the IOT world.

My love for technology began at age 6 when I wrote my first lines of BASIC code on a TI-99/4A. From the moment that I saw my name printed across the screen, I knew what I wanted to be  when I grew up. More than twenty years of professional experience later, I still hold onto that child-like sense of wonder and feel incredibly fortunate that I've been able to build a career around something which I'm passionate about and would be doing as a hobby regardless.

I am a Senior Software Engineer on the Azure Developer Platform team at Microsoft, focused on ensuring that developers around the world have a first-class experience leveraging Azure services in their applications.  Our goal is to build SDKs and tools for Azure that look and feel consistent with the language and technology stack that they are built on, and which provide an API that is intuitive and powerful for developers.  Development is done in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk), embracing community feedback and contributions to ensure that the products we deliver meet real-world needs and expectations.

Previously, I was an engineer in Microsoft's Commercial Software Engineering group.  There, I partnered with Microsoft customers to help them achieve success building software using Microsoft platforms, services, and technologies such as Azure, Xbox, HoloLens, and Windows.  Our goal was to meet partners where they are, coding together to solve real-world business problems.  Being effective meant embracing a diverse set of tools, languages, and technical environments - both Microsoft and non-Microsoft.

Prior to that, I worked at 343 Industries on the Halo Services team, helping to design and deliver service offerings that support the ecosystem of Halo games and the larger Halo universe.  My  contributions included services for Halo 5: Guardians, Halo 5:Forge, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Halo: Spartan Strike, Halo Channel, as well as other Halo properties.  My love of  technology began with a love of games; I wrote my first lines of code and played my first video game at roughly the same time.  Having the opportunity to  make games professionally,  especially for a series as beloved as Halo, was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.

In my past, I've served in various roles involving the architecture, development, delivery, and management of software products and the teams that deliver them.  I have been responsible for a diverse set of duties such as managing geographically distributed development teams, leading the technical direction of products and organizations, establishing a healthy and inclusive team culture, building technical standards, team and peer mentorship, and the delivery of software products.

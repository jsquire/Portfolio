# Jesse Squire's Portfolio #

### Overview ###

Included in this repository are documents and code meant to serve as representative samples of my work.  The code projects are intentionally small and non-complex.  They are intended only to serve as a window into my coding habits, style, and thought processes, not to illustrate large and complex development projects.  This portfolio is best viewed as an artifact that will continue to evolve over time.


Included are projects, documents, and presentations that were either created as personal items (on personal time, using my own equipment and not intended for any employers or clients) or were approved for public release.  While some works may be considered derivative of work done for employers or clients, they were created without referencing any source document or code from other artifacts.  To my knowledge nothing contained herein is considered proprietary or confidential to any of my employers, past or present.  In the event that a former employer or client feels otherwise, please contact me and I'd be happy to discuss the disputed material.


### Structure ###

* **root**
  <br />_The root contains the overall repository configuration files, license, and general structure._
  
* **resume**
  <br />_The container for my current resume in various formats._  
  
* **documents**
  <br />_The base container for document samples.  These are further organized by subfolder to catagorize the document type._
  
* **src**
  <br />_The base container for code samples.  These are also further organized by subfolder to differentiate projects and languages/platforms.  In cases where there are multiple language/platform versions of a particular project, the hierarchy may be deeper than otherwise.  The intent is that each code or project sample is independent._
  
  
Each independent document, code sample, or project area will have a dedicated ReadMe file to offer context-sensitive information about the resources being viewed.
 

### Licensing ###
The artifacts in this portfolio are offered under the MIT license, as described in the accompanying [license](./LICENSE "license") file.  Feel free to use the code in your own projects or the documents as templates as you see fit.  Should these works prove helpful or inspire you to iterate on them in creative ways, I find that to be a huge compliment.  We all build upon the work of those who have come before us.  In general, formal attribution is not necessary, though it is always appreciated.  I do ask, however, that you not copy an item verbatim and pass it off as your own work.
